<h3 id="boss">The Boss Level</h3>
<p>My husband and I have three children, and none of them came into the world easily. I didn’t get to hear my children’s first cries when they were born because none of them could physically do so. One day while thinking about each birth, I thought that though all three of them were hard, the difficulty ramped up with each one. Both he and I enjoy video games, so I made the comparison of our third child being “the boss level,” where you have to overcome the greatest challenges. I played the original Super Mario Brothers in my childhood, so I can’t help but think that it’s appropriate that after we beat the boss level, there was a princess waiting for us at the end. </p>
<br> 
<h3 id="secondary">Secondary Infertility</h3>

<p>We were able to get pregnant with our first two children, two boys, relatively easily but were faced with a few complications during their birth and shortly afterwards. Here is a brief summary of what happened with them.</p>

After trying for a third baby for about 10 years and after many medical tests and procedures, we learned that we would need to go through invitro fertilization (IVF) if we wanted to have another child. Through a few other miracles not discussed here, we were able to procure the funding for this very expensive procedure and found out in March of 2021 that we were indeed pregnant with a baby girl due early September of that year. 
Below is a visualization of infertility rates in America, and proof of the need for infertility treatment to be required coverage of all medical insurance companies.

<h3 id="mayday">Mayday</h3>

	<p> We were all elated at the thought of a sweet baby girl who would join our family in the coming months. My due date was September 2nd of 2021, one day before our 16th wedding anniversary. Life continued as normal and at the time I was working overnight at a local hotel.</p>
<p>On May 1st, I went to work as normal, expecting a slow night with the hardest part of my job being trying to stay awake. While using the restroom around 3 a.m., I felt something pop that I had not felt with my prior two pregnancies. I immediately had an anxious feeling and decided to call the on-call doctor for by OBGYN clinic. I told her that I thought my water had broken and she told me to go to the hospital immediately to get checked out. I called in my replacement because I was the only one working at the time, and woke up my husband, telling him to meet me at the hospital down the road from our home.</p>
<p>I remember driving down the deserted main street, having never been so scared in my entire life, tears streaming down my face afraid that we were about to lose the little girl we had worked so hard to get.</p>
<p>When we arrived, I was taken to the Labor and Delivery department where they hooked me up to some monitoring and took a sample of the fluid that was coming out of me. Sure enough, my water had broken, but fortunately I was not in active labor. The doctor sent us home and told me to meet as soon as I could with a pregnancy trauma specialist for an ultrasound and an update. This was a Saturday morning and I was able to get an appointment for that upcoming Tuesday.</p>
<p>The doctor’s tone was so negative, telling me the chances of my baby’s survival were so small and asked me what I wanted to do, alluding to abortion. I’ll never forget looking him straight in the eyes and telling him with absolute surety that I would be taking every life saving measure possible to save our daughter. The doctor then told me that I would have to check in to the hospital in two days and stay there until I gave birth.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="summer">My Summer Home</h3>
<p>I was assigned to check in at the Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah, about a 45-minute drive away from my home in Tooele. I ended up staying for what was a total of 76 days, from May 6th through July 20th, 2021. To say that this time was difficult would be quite an understatement. </p>
<p>My days were long, painful and exhausting. Nurses came into my room all    throughout the day to draw blood, take my blood pressure, and ask me the same questions over and over again. Every day, I was taken to a different floor of the hospital for a non-stress test where they would monitor the baby to see if she was moving enough and if her heartbeat was ok. </p>   
<p>I tried to pass the time by doing a lot of cross-stitching, reading, jigsaw puzzles, and watching shows on my iPad. The food wasn’t very good in the hospital so I quickly became very grateful for services like DoorDash so I could order restaurant food to my hospital room. My husband would sometimes bring me food and we would have dates in my room, eating and watching a movie. I didn’t sleep very well with all of the interruptions, so I was constantly tired and never felt good. It was so hard to want to come home so badly and be with my husband and boys. But I kept at it, knowing that this was where I needed to be to give my little girl her best shot at surviving.  </p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="birthday">An Early Birthday</h3>
<p>The weeks kept on and I knew that my time at the hospital was coming to an end. The doctors told me that if I hadn’t delivered before 34 weeks that they would induce me at that time. At that point in a pregnancy, the risk of infection from my water being broken was still really high and at 34 weeks gestation a baby is able to survive, especially because the hospital I was at had a high-level NICU attached to it.</p>
<p>On July 18th, I went in for my non-stress test like normal and the results were different than every other day. This caused the nurses to send me to the labor and delivery floor for further monitoring. This had happened once before during my time there, so I didn’t think much of it, but this time it turned out that I was in labor. I called my husband, and he sent the boys to a neighbor’s house and made the long drive to the hospital. </p>
<p>My husband arrived and I thought we wouldn’t have to wait long but it took several hours and some Pitocin for my labor to progress. The doctors wanted me to have an epidural in case I needed to have an emergency c-section, so I agreed to that and the process went very smoothly. Around 11:30 pm, I was ready to be wheeled into the delivery room to begin pushing. It was a special room with a window that let directly to the NICU so they could immediately hand the baby over to the NICU team. After a few pushes, Maggie Lee Young was born on July 19th, 2021.</p>

<p>I barely glimpsed Maggie before she was handed through the window to waiting, capable hands who could help her. I was wheeled back to a room to be cleaned up and was later transferred to a wheelchair so my husband and I could go up to the NICU to see her. She had all sorts of tubes in her that we could barely see her face and we couldn’t hold her yet, but she was stable, and she was alive. </p>
<p>I had a horrible headache after pushing so I went back to my room and quickly fell asleep. Around 10 a.m. that morning I woke up, and my husband went to get us some breakfast at McDonald’s. I wanted to go home that day but was required to stay at the hospital for 24 hours after giving birth, so I stuck it out for another day. </p>
<p>The next day I was finally able to go home. It was hard to leave Maggie in the NICU, but I knew she was in skilled hands who knew how to take care of her. I was able to go down to the NICU before I left and hold her for the first time. I couldn’t wait to be with my boys, to be in my bed, and to be in my home. </p>

<p>Maggie ended up having to stay in the NICU for 38 days. My husband and I visited her as much as we could, living as far away as we did and having two boys in school. She was on supplemental oxygen for a while, and it took her a while to be strong enough to eat enough without a feeding tube. </p>
<p>My family and I are so grateful to have her in our lives. She is so delightful and happy and a joy to be around. She loves to share and has a natural nurturing side. She fought to make it to this world, and I know that the world is better because she is in it.  </p>
<p>Here is a fun video of Maggie when she was about 6 months old.</p>
